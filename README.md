**<s>My laptop is broken. So I am not able to work or do anything untill a time.</s> I fixed it.**

Little talk:

I would like to say, for example, what I know and what technologies I work with. But do you know, okay, I should say, for example what is my laptop, what effect does it have on my resume?

I really don't like to show off too much. My personal life is related to me. So, I am not like people who put everything in their resume. Like my hobby is watching movie or my favorite game is GTA V. 

Here you don't see the logo of programming language and framework and these things. I'm not not fan of images and logos, so you can see just plain text!
